## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- onchange event in input field does not run the callback function until the input field loses focus. To run the callback function on every change, use oninput event.
- `try - catch - finally` block in JavaScript.
- `toFixed()` method in JavaScript.
- select `input::placeholder` in CSS.
